# BIAlertBot
BlueIris AI Person detector/Telegram Bot

Sketched out a quick Telegram "Bot" to send an image from Blue Iris 
if a person was detected in the image. Eventually will interface with
either a web frontend to enable and disable as well as add in some proper
error checking and a proper config file.

Add run_detect.bat as a program that gets run on alert. Before that an
image must be set to save on Alert for it to check.
